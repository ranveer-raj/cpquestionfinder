Given an array AA consisting of NN integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN, determine if you can sort this array by applying the following operation several times (possibly, zero):

Pick a pair of indices (i,j) with i≠j and Ai&Aj≠0, and swap the values of Ai and Aj. Here, & denotes the bitwise AND operation.

For example, if A=[6,4,2], the two possible operations are (1,2) and (1,3). (2,3) cannot be performed because A2&A3=4&2=0.
Input Format

The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN

Output Format
For each test case, output the answer on a new line — YES if the given array can be sorted by repeatedly applying the given operation, and NO otherwise.
You may print each character of the answer string in either uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes" and "YES" will all be treated as identical).
Constraints

1≤T≤104
1≤N≤3⋅105
0≤Ai<231 for each 1≤i≤N
The sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅105

Yes
Yes
No
No


Explanation
Test case 1: A can be sorted by applying the single operation (1,3).
Test case 2: A can be sorted by applying the following operations in order: (1,5),(2,6),(2,3),(4,5).
Test cases 3 and 4: It can be shown that no sequence of operations will sort A.
