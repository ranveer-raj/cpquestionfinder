Chef bought a huge (effectively infinite) planar island and built N restaurants (numbered 1 through N) on it. For each valid i, the Cartesian coordinates of restaurant i are (Xi,Yi).
Now, Chef wants to build N−1 straight narrow roads (line segments) on the island. The roads may have arbitrary lengths; restaurants do not have to lie on the roads. The slope of each road must be 1 or −1, i.e. for any two points (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) on the same road, |x1−x2|=|y1−y2| must hold.
Let's denote the minimum distance Chef has to walk from restaurant i to reach a road by Di. Then, let's denote a=max(D1,D2,…,DN); Chef wants this distance to be minimum possible.
Chef is a busy person, so he decided to give you the job of building the roads. You should find a way to build them that minimises a and compute a⋅√2.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
N lines follow. For each valid i, the i-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers Xi and Yi.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one real number — the minimum distance a multiplied by √2. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10−6.

Explanation
Example case 1: We should build roads described by equations y−x+0.5=0 and y−x−0.5=0.
Example case 2: We should build roads described by equations y−x−1=0 and y+x−1=0.
