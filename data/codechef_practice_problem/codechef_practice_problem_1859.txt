Chef is given two arrays AA and BB, each having NN elements.
In one move, Chef can choose an index i (1≤i≤N−1), get (Ai−Ai+1) points, and then swap Ai and Ai+1.
For example: If Chef has the array - [10,7,5] and Chef chooses index 1 during his move, he will get 10−7=3 points and the new array will become [7,10,5]
Can you help Chef in finding the maximum number of points he can get while converting the array A into array B?
Note: It is guaranteed in the input that there exists a sequence of moves which can convert array A into B.
Input Format

The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of testcases. The description of the T testcases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of elements in A and B.
The second line of each test case contains N space separated integers A1,A2,...,AN.
The third line of each test case contains N space separated integers B1,B2,...,BN.

Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer, which is the maximum number of points that Chef can get while converting the array A into array B
Constraints

1≤T≤5⋅104
2≤N≤5⋅105
1≤Ai≤105
1≤Bi≤105
The sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 5⋅105

Explanation
Test Case 1: Chef can choose i=1 in the first move, get 1−2=−1 points and swap A1 and A2. After this move, A is converted into B. We can prove that there exists no other sequence of moves which can result in higher score while converting A into B.
Test Case 2: One possible sequence of moves is the following:

Choose i=2. Total points =1, and A will become [3,1,2].
Choose i=1. Total points =1+2, and A will become [1,3,2].
Choose i=2. Total points =1+2+1, and A will become [1,2,3].

There are other possible sequences of moves which can result in total 4 points, but no such sequence exists which can result in more than 4 points, and simultaneously convert A into B.
