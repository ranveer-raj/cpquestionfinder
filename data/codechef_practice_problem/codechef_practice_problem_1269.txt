A circular binary string is called good if it contains at least one character '1' and there is an integer d such that for each character '1', the distance to the nearest character '1' clockwise is d.
You are given a circular binary string S with length N. You may choose some characters in this string and flip them (i.e. change '1' to '0' or vice versa). Convert the given string into a good string by flipping the smallest possible number of characters.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line contains a single string S with length N.

Output
Print a single line containing one integer ― the minimum number of flips required to transform the initial string into a good string.
Constraints

1≤T≤100
1≤N≤5⋅105
S contains only characters '0' and '1'
the sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 5⋅105
