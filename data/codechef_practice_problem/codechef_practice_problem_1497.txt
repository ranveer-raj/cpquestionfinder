Find the length of the longest contiguous segment in an array, in which if a given element KK is inserted, KK becomes the second largest element of that subarray.
Input:

The first line will contain TT, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. 
The first line of each test case contains two integers NN and KK.
The next line contains N space-separated integers Ai denoting the elements of the array.

Output:
Print a single line corresponding to each test case — the length of the largest segment.
Constraints

1≤T≤101≤T≤10
1≤N≤1061≤N≤106
1≤Ai,K≤1091≤Ai,K≤109
Sum of N across all test cases doesn't exceed 106106

    5
    3


Explanation
If 3 is inserted at anywhere in the array, it is the second largest element. Hence the maximum length is 5.
If 5 is inserted anywhere between 1st and 4th element, it is the second largest element. The length of such subarray is 3.
