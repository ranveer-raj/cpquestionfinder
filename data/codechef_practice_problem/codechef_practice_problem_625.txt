 Chef loves lucky numbers. Everybody knows that lucky numbers are positive integers whose decimal representation contains only the lucky digits 4 and 7. For example, numbers 47, 744, 4 are lucky and 5, 17, 467 are not.

 Chef has a positive integer N. He can apply any of the following operations as many times as he want in any order:

 Add 1 to the number N.
 Take some digit of N and replace it by any non-zero digit.
 Add any non-zero leading digit to N.
 Find the minimum number of operations that is needed for changing N to the lucky number.

Input
The first line contains a single positive integer T, the number of test cases. T test cases follow. The only line of each test case contains a positive integer N without leading zeros. 

Output
For each T test cases print one integer, the minimum number of operations that is needed for changing N to the lucky number.

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 10

1 ≤ N < 10100000
