You are given positive integers LL and RR. You have to find the sum
S=R∑i=L(L∧(L+1)∧…∧i),S=∑i=LR(L∧(L+1)∧…∧i),
where ∧ denotes the bitwise AND operation. Since the sum could be large, compute it modulo 109+7.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers L and R.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the sum S modulo 109+7.
Constraints

1≤T≤105
1≤L≤R≤1018

1
16


Explanation
Example case 1: The sum is 1 + 1 AND 2 + 1 AND 2 AND 3 + 1 AND 2 AND 3 AND 4 = 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 1.
Example case 2: The sum is 4 + 4 AND 5 + 4 AND 5 AND 6 + 4 AND 5 AND 6 AND 7 + … + 4 AND 5 AND … AND 10 = 4 + 4 + … + 0 = 16.
