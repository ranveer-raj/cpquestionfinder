Chef's exam is near. There is a total of MM subjects in his syllabus. Each subject consists of several topics. However, the questions will be set only from NN topics. These topics are numbered 1 through N. The ith topic belongs to Cthi subject and takes Ti hours to cover.
Chef has only K hours left before the exam and wants to score the maximum marks. If Chef covers x1 number of topics of the 1st subject, x2 number of topics of the 2nd subject, and so on upto  xM number of topics of the Mth subject in the remaining K hours, he will get a total of ⌈x12 ⌉+⌈x22 ⌉+⋯+⌈xM2 ⌉ marks in the exam. So Chef chooses the topics optimally.
Determine the maximum possible marks Chef can score in the exam.
Note: ⌈x⌉ : Returns the smallest integer that is greater than or equal to x (i.e  rounds up to the nearest integer). For example, ⌈1.5⌉=2, ⌈5⌉=5.
Input Format

The first line of input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
Each test case contains three lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers N,M,K.
The second line contains N space-separated integers C1,C2,…,CN.
The third line contains N space-separated integers T1,T2,…,TN.

Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer - the maximum marks Chef can score.
Constraints

1≤T≤104
1≤N≤105
1≤M≤N
1≤K≤109
1≤Ci≤M
1≤Ti≤109
Sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 5⋅105.

Explanation
Test case 1: Chef covers the 1st and 2nd topic in 1+1=2 hours. Both topics belongs to 1st subject. He does not cover any topic of the second subject. By doing so, Chef gets ⌈22 ⌉+⌈02 ⌉ = ⌈ 1 ⌉+⌈ 0 ⌉=1 marks.
Test case 2: Chef covers the 1st topic which belongs to the first subject and 4th topic which belongs to the second subject in 1+1=2 hours. There is no topic from the third subject. So Chef gets ⌈12 ⌉+⌈12 ⌉ = ⌈ 0.5 ⌉+⌈ 0.5 ⌉=1+1=2 marks.
