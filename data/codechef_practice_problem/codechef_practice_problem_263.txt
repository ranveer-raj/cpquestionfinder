Today is Chef's birthday and he is looking forward to his gift. As usual, the gift is hidden and Chef has to follow a sequence of NN instructions to reach it.
Initially, Chef is standing in the cell (0,0)(0,0) of a two-dimensional grid. The sequence of instructions is given as a string SS. If we denote Chef's current cell by (x,y)(x,y), each character of SS corresponds to an instruction as follows:

'L' means to go left, i.e. to the cell (x−1,y)(x−1,y)
'R' means to go right, i.e. to the cell (x+1,y)(x+1,y)
'U' means to go up, i.e. to the cell (x,y+1)(x,y+1)
'D' means to go down, i.e. to the cell (x,y−1)(x,y−1)

In addition, Chef should never perform multiple consecutive moves along the same axis of the grid. If there are multiple consecutive instructions to move along the same axis (left/right or up/down), he should perform only the first of these moves.
Find the cell (xg,yg)(xg,yg) which contains the hidden gift.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer NN.
The second line contains a single string SS with length NN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing two space-separated integers xgxg and ygyg.
Constraints

1≤T≤1001≤T≤100
1≤N≤1,0001≤N≤1,000
SS contains only characters 'L', 'R', 'U' and 'D'

Explanation
Example case 1: Chef's path is (0,0)→(−1,0)→(−1,0)→(−1,0)→(−1,1)→(0,1)(0,0)→(−1,0)→(−1,0)→(−1,0)→(−1,1)→(0,1).
