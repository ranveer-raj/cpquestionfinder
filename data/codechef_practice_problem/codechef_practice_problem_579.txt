Mr. Pr and Ms. Ad are at aa and bb respectively on an infinite number line. Mr. Pr wants to meet Ms. Ad.
Mr. Pr can choose to move  cc or d units in 1 second. If Mr. Pr moves c units then Ms. Ad will move d units and vice versa. (Both of them always moved in positive x-direction)
You have to determine if Mr. Pr can meet with Ms. Ad after some integral amount of time, given that Mr. Pr chooses optimally. Note that meeting after a fractional amount of time does not count.
Input:

First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
Each testcase contains four space separated integers, a, b, c, and d.

Output:

For each test case, output a single line containing "YES" if Mr. Pr meets with Ms. Ad, otherwise "NO".

Constraints

1≤T≤105
1≤a,b,c,d≤109


                        Sample Input 1
                        





2
3 4 1 2
10 20 3 7



                        Sample Output 1
                        





YES
NO


Explanation
In the first test case, Mr. Pr will move 2 units in the first second and Ms. Ad moves 1 unit simultaneously and they meet. 
In the second test case, it is impossible to meet (fractional time is not allowed).
