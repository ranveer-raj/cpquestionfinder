Suppose we have a 2D grid AA of infinite width and height of NN units. Each row of the grid can be represented in the form of 111…100…∞111…100…∞ where the 11s are repeated x times, x>0. Implying that the row starts with x consecutive 1-s followed by all 0-s. 
Initially all cells are unmarked. Cell (i,j) refers to the i-th row, and j-th column. (1,1) refers to the bottom-left cell.
Now you do the following in each step.
Choose an unmarked cell having 1. Let it be (i, j).
while((i,j) lies in the grid boundaries && A[i][j] == 1){
    mark[i][j] = true; i--; j--;
}

How many minimum number of steps are required to mark all the cells containing 1?
Note: The number of consecutive 1-s at each height is given by the array W where Wi represents the same at ith row.
Input:

First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
Each testcase contain 2 lines of input.
First line will contain N, height of the grid (number of rows). 
Second line contains N space separated integers where ith index represents number of consecutive 1-s at the beginning of row i.

Output:
For each testcase, output in a single line answer to the problem.
Constraints

1≤T≤10
1≤N≤105
1≤Wi≤109

Explanation
TestCase 1: All the points need to be considered to cover all 1-s.
TestCase 2: The optimal set of starting points is {(1,3),(2,3),(2,2),(3,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1)}.
