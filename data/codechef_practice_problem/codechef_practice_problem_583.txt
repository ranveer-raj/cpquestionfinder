Shefin gives you a string SS and you have to find a non-empty string PP such that:  

PP is a substring of S.
No non-empty substring of P is a prefix of S.
No non-empty substring of P is a suffix of S.

For all such possible strings, find the length of the longest string satisfying all the conditions. If no such string is possible, print −1. 
A string A is a substring of a string B if A can be obtained from B by deleting several (possibly zero) characters from the beginning and several (possibly zero) characters from the end.
A prefix of a string A, is a substring of A that occurs at the beginning of A. For example, "code" is a prefix of "codechef", but "ode" is not.
A suffix of a string A, is a substring of A that occurs at the end of A. For example, "chef" is a suffix of "codechef", but "he" is not.
Input Format

The first line of the input contains an integer T - denoting number of test cases.
Each test case contains a string S consisting of lowercase english alphabets only. 

Output Format
For each test case, print a single integer. If a string P exists based on the given conditions, print the maximum length of the possible string. Otherwise, print −1.
Constraints

1≤T≤104
1≤|S|≤106
Sum of |S| over all test cases does not exceed 106.
S consists of lowercase english alphabets only.


                        Sample Input 1
                        





2
abcdab
aaa



                        Sample Output 1
                        





2
-1


Explanation
Test Case 1: The maximum length of the string satisfying all required conditions is 2. The string cd satisfies all the conditions. It can be proven that no string of length greater than 2 exists which can satisfy all the conditions.  
Test Case 2: There is no string possible which satisfies all the required conditions. Thus, the answer is −1.
