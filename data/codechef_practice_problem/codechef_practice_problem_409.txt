One day, Chef's friend gave him a wrong number WW containing N+1N+1 digits and said that the actual number AA is the largest possible number that can be obtained from deleting exactly one digit of WW. Chef was able to find AA but forgot WW. 
Given AA, find the smallest possible number WW of length N+1N+1 without leading 00's that is consistent with the story above. We can show that there is always at least one such WW consistent with the story.
Input

The first line contains an integer TT, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. 
Each test case contains a single line of input, an integer AA. 

Output
For each testcase, output in a single line string representing the answer to the problem.
Constraints

1≤T≤1001≤T≤100
0≤Ai≤90≤Ai≤9 for all valid ii, where AiAi denotes the ii-th digit of AA
A1≠0A1≠0 (no leading zero)
10≤|A|≤500010≤|A|≤5000, where |A||A| denotes the number of digits of AA
