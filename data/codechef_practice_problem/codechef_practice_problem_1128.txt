Teddy and Tracy like to play a game based on strings. The game is as follows. Initially, Tracy writes a long random string on a whiteboard. Then, each player starting with Teddy makes turn alternately. Each turn, the player must erase a contiguous substring that exists in the dictionary. The dictionary consists of N words.
Of course, the player that can't erase any substring in his turn loses the game, and the other player is declared the winner.
Note that after a substring R is erased, the remaining substring becomes separated, i.e. they cannot erase a word that occurs partially to the left of R and partially to the right of R.

Determine the winner of the game, assuming that both players play optimally.
Input
The first line contains a single integer T, the number of test cases. T test cases follow. The first line of each testcase contains a string S, the string Tracy writes on the whiteboard. The next line contains a single integer N. N lines follow. The i-th line contains a single string wi, the i-th word in the dictionary.
Output
For each test case, output a single line containing the name of the winner of the game.
Constraints
1 <= T <= 5
1 <= N <= 30
1 <= |S| <= 30
1 <= |wi| <= 30
S and wi contain only characters 'a'-'z'
