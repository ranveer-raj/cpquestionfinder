There are NN people standing in a queue for Chef's ice cream. They are numbered 11 through NN from the front to the back of the queue.
Chef's customers do not like to wait too long. For each valid ii, we know that the ice cream ordered by the ii-th person will take PiPi seconds to prepare and cost ViVi units of money, but if this person has to wait strictly more than WiWi seconds in the queue (until Chef starts preparing their order), they will leave. At any time, it is only allowed to prepare the ice cream of the person standing at the front of the queue.
Chef wants to maximise his profit (the sum of prices of sold ice creams). In order to do that, he may choose to kick some of the customers (possibly nobody) out of the queue. Find the maximum profit Chef can make.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer NN.
NN lines follow. For each ii (1≤i≤N1≤i≤N), each of these lines contains three space-separated integers WiWi, PiPi and ViVi.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the maximum possible profit.
