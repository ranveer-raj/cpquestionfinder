Chef Avi likes the number KK. Given a list of NN integers, help him find the sum of all distinct numbers repeating exactly KK times. Each of those numbers should be considered only once in the sum, not KK times.
Input:

First line will contain TT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
Each testcase contains two lines:
The first line contains two space-separated integers N,KN,K. 
The second line contains NN space-separated integers.

Output:
For each testcase, print the sum of all numbers occurring exactly KK times. If there is no such number, print -1 instead.

5
9
-1


Explanation
Test Case 1: The numbers 2 and 3 occur exactly once. So the answer is 2 + 3 = 5.
Test Case 2: The number 9 occurs exactly three times. So the answer is 9.
Test Case 3: There is no number which occurs exactly once. Hence the answer is -1.
