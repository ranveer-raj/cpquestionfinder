Almir had a small sequence A1,A2,…,AN. He decided to make K copies of this sequence and concatenate them, forming a sequence X1,X2,…,XNK; for each valid i and j (0≤j<K), Xj⋅N+i=Ai.
For example, if A=(1,2,3) and K=4, the final sequence is X=(1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3).
A pair (i,j), where 1≤i<j≤N, is an inversion if Xi>Xj. Find the number of inversions in the final sequence X.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and K.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the number of inversions in the sequence X.
