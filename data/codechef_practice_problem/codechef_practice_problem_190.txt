An array AA of length NN is said to be pseudo-sorted if it can be made non-decreasing after performing the following operation at most once.

Choose an ii such that 1≤i≤N−11≤i≤N−1 and swap AiAi and Ai+1Ai+1

Given an array AA, determine if it is pseudo-sorted or not.
Input Format

The first line contains a single integer TT - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains an integer NN - the size of the array AA.
The second line of each test case contains NN space-separated integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN denoting the array AA.

Output Format
For each testcase, output YES if the array AA is pseudo-sorted, NO otherwise.
You may print each character of YES and NO in uppercase or lowercase (for example, yes, yEs, Yes will be considered identical).
Constraints

1≤T≤10001≤T≤1000
2≤N≤1052≤N≤105
1≤Ai≤1091≤Ai≤109
Sum of NN over all test cases do not exceed 2⋅1052⋅105

YES
YES
NO


Explanation
Test case 1: The array is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
Test case 2: We can choose i=2i=2 and swap A2A2 and A3A3. The resulting array will be [1,2,3,3][1,2,3,3], which is sorted in non-decreasing order.
Test case 3: It can be proven that the array cannot be sorted in non-decreasing order in at most one operation.
