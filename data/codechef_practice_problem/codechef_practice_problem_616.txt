Katya has a sequence of integers a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an and an integer mm.
She defines a good sequence of integers as a non-empty sequence such that the sum of the elements in each of its non-empty subsequences is divisible by mm.
Katya wants to know the number of good subsequences of the sequence aa. Can you help her?
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers nn and mm.
The second line contains nn space-separated integers a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the number of good subsequences.
