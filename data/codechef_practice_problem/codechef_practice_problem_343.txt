Today Chef wants to evaluate the dishes of his NN students. He asks each one to cook a dish and present it to him.
Chef loves his secret ingredient, and only likes dishes with at least XX grams of it.
Given NN, XX and the amount of secret ingredient used by each student AiAi, find out whether Chef will like at least one dish. 
Input:

First line will contain TT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
The first line of each testcase contains two integers NN 
(number of students) and XX (minimum amount of secret ingredient that a dish must contain for Chef to like it).
The next line contains NN space separated integers, AiAi denoting the amount of secret ingredient used by the students in their dishes.

Output:
For each testcase, print a single string "YES" if Chef likes at least one dish. Otherwise, print "NO". (Without quotes).
