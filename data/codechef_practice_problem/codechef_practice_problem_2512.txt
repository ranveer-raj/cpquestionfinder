One free afternoon, Chef found an old board game in his kitchen. He decided to invite his friends Miron and Slava to come play it with him. 
The board is a rectangular grid of size  2 × N. Initially, Miron and Slava each put their chips at a location (x1,y1 ) and (x2,y2 ) respectively. The game then proceeds as follows : 


 Each player moves their chip in turns.
 In each turn, a player can move his chip to an adjacent cell that has not been visited by the other player before.
 Two cells are adjacent if they share a side
 A player can also skip his turn
 The cell that is initially occupied by a particular player's chip is considered visited by him


 The outcome of the game is decided as follows : 

 If a player manages to visit strictly more than half the total number of cells (i.e. visited at least N+1 cells), he immediately wins and the other player loses.
if the game continued for more than 10100 turns without any player declared a winner yet then it becomes a draw.


Given that both players move optimally and Miron starts first, can you help Chef predict the winner of the game?
Input
 The first line contains a single integer T, the number of test cases. Each test case is described by a single line containing five space-separated integers N, x1, y1, x2, y2. 
Output
For each test case, output a single line with string Miron, Slava or Draw, denoting the answer to the problem.
Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤  105 
1 ≤ N ≤  1018 
1 ≤ x1, x2  ≤  2
1 ≤ y1, y2  ≤  N
Cells (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are different.
