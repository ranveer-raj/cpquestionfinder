Chef likes strings a lot but moreover he likes good strings. Chef calls a string str a good string if str starts and ends at different characters. For eg : strings such as abab , baccba , abc are all good strings whereas strings like aba, baab , baacaab are not good at all .
Today, Chef has a special string P consisting of lower case letters "c" , "h" , "e" and "f" only. Chef wants to make some queries about his string P.
Each of chef's query has the following form a b L R. For a given query, Chef wants to count the number of good strings which starts at letter a and ends at letter b such that starting index Si and ending index Ei of a chosen substring satisfies L <= Si < Ei <= R.
NOTE
Two substrings P1 and P2 are considered to be different if either S1 != S2 or E1 != E2 where S1,E1 and S2,E2 are the starting and ending index of string P1 and string P2 respectively.
Chef is not able to accomplish this task efficiently. Can you help him ?
Input
First line of the input contains a string P denoting the chef's special string. Next line of the input contains a single integer Q denoting the number of chef's queries. Next Q lines of the input contains four space separated parameters where the first two parameters are characters denoting a and b respectively and rest two are integers denoting L and R respectively.

Output
For each chef's query, print the required answer.
Constraints
1 <= |P| <= 106
1 <= Q <= 106
1 <= L <= R <= |P|
P,a,b belongs to the set of lower case letters [c,h,e,f] and a != b. 		
All test files are strictly according to constraints.
Subtasks
 Subtask #1: 1<=|P|,Q<=104 : 27 pts
 Subtask #2: 1<=|P|,Q<=105 : 25 pts
 Subtask #3: 1<=|P|,Q<=106 : 48 pts
Warning
Large test data set, Prefer to use faster input/output methods .
