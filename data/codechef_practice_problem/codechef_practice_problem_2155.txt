You are given a tree rooted at node 11 with NN vertices. The ith vertex initially has value Ai(1≤i≤N). You are also given Q queries. 
In each query you are given a vertex V.  Let S={S1,S2,...Sx} denote the set of vertices such that Si is in the subtree of V, distance between Si and V is even and Si≠V for all i. For all Si , add ASi to AV and change the value of ASi to zero.
Find the values of all the vertices after all queries are performed. 
Note-The distance between two vertices is defined as the number of edges
traversed on the shortest path from one vertex to the other.
Input:

The first line contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contain two integers N and Q.
The second line contains N space separated integers, A1,A2,...,An denoting the initial values of the vertices.
The next N−1 lines contain two integers u and v denoting an edge between uand v.
The next Q lines contain a single integer which is the query.

Output:

Print a single line containing N integers for each test case which is the final values of the vertices.

Constraints:

1≤T≤10
1≤N≤200000
1≤Q≤200000
0≤Ai≤109
The sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 200000.
The sum of Q over all test cases does not exceed 200000.

Explanation
Node 3 has no child in its subtree which is at  an even distance so there is no change in the values. Values of nodes after 1st query: 6,2,7,3.
Node 4 is at an even distance in the subtree of node 2 so A4 gets added to A2 and A4 becomes 0. Values of nodes after 2nd query: 6,5,7,0.
Node 3 is at an even distance in the subtree of node 1 so A3 gets added to A1 and A3 becomes 0. Values of nodes after 3rd query: 13,5,0,0.
