On the matrix A sized n×n, some cells were marked by crosses (X). For each cell (i,j) (with i – the row index, j – the column index), we define B(i,j) as the maximal number of continuous crosses “going across” the cell (i,j) in the same horizontal, vertical or diagonal; B(i,j)=0 if A(i,j) is empty ( '.' ).
[ Empty cells are marked by '.'] .

Clarification:
Continuous crosses going across cell (i,j) in horizontal direction = x1 + x2 - 1
where x1 = highest possible x such that
          j + x - 1<= n and A(i, j ... j + x - 1) are all 'X'
and x2 = highest possible x such that
          j - x + 1 > 0  and A(i, j - x + 1...j) are all 'X'
Similarily we can extend the definition for vertical and diagonal directions.

Task
Given matrix A as input, calculate matrix B.
Input

 The first line contains the integer n. 
 Then follow n lines , each containing n characters. The j-th character of the i-th line represents the cell (i,j) of the matrix A, with A(i,j)='X' if it contains a cross, or A(i,j)='.' if it is empty. 
Output

Output n lines, each contains n integers, the j-th integer of the i-th line shows the value of B(i,j).(Each integer on a same line must be separated by exactly one space character)
