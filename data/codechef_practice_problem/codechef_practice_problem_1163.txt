Chef has a tasty ingredient ― an integer KK. He defines a tasty matrix AA with NN rows (numbered 1 through N) and M columns (numbered 1 through M) as Ai,j=K+i+j for each valid i,j.
Currently, Chef is busy in the kitchen making this tasty matrix. Help him find the bitwise XOR of all elements of this matrix.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains three space-separated integers N, M and K.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the bitwise XOR of all elements of the tasty matrix with the given dimensions made with the given special ingredient. 
Constraints

1≤T≤105
1≤N,M≤2⋅106
1≤K≤109
the sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅106
the sum of M over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅106

Explanation
Example case 1: The matrix is
A=(5+1+15+1+25+2+15+2+2)=(7889).
The XOR of all its elements is 7⊕8⊕8⊕9=14.
Example case 2: The matrix is
A=(7+1+17+1+27+1+37+2+17+2+27+2+3)=(91011101112).
The XOR of all its elements is 9⊕10⊕11⊕10⊕11⊕12=5.
