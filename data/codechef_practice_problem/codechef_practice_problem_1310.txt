Given a set of N integer points on the Cartesian plane. Your task is to find an integer point satisfying its sum of distances to N given points (S) is minimum.

Input
There are several test cases (fifteen at most), each formed as follows:
The first line contains a positive integer N (N ≤ 2,000).
N lines follow, each containing a pair of integers (each having an absolute value of 109 at most) describing coordinates of a given point.

The input is ended with N = 0.


Output
For each test case, output on a line a real number (with exactly 6 decimal places) which is the respective minimum sum S found.
