Chef has an integer NN. He repeats the following operation until NN becomes 11.

Chef chooses an integer XX such that X>1X>1 and XX is a divisor of NN and then divides NN by XX (the new value of NN becomes N/XN/X). If XX is even, Chef gets AA points otherwise he gets BB points

Can you find the maximum points Chef can get if he performs the operations optimally?
Input Format

First line will contain TT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
Each testcase contains of a single line of input containing three integers N,A,BN,A,B.

Output Format
For each testcase, output in a single line the maximum points Chef can get.

Explanation
Test case 11: First Chef divides N=10N=10 by 22 and gets 22 points and then divides by 55 and thus gets 33 points. Hence Chef gets a total of 2+3=52+3=5 points.
Test case 22: Chef divides NN by 1515. Hence he gets −2−2 points.
