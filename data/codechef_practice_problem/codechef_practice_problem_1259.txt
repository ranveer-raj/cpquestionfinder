Consider a very long K-digit number N with digits d0, d1, ..., dK-1 (in decimal notation; d0 is the most significant and dK-1 the least significant digit). This number is so large that we can't give it to you on the input explicitly; instead, you are only given its starting digits and a way to construct the remainder of the number.


Specifically, you are given d0 and d1; for each i ≥ 2, di is the sum of all preceding (more significant) digits, modulo 10 — more formally, the following formula must hold:



Determine if N is a multiple of 3.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains three space-separated integers K, d0 and d1.

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing the string "YES" (without quotes) if the number N is a multiple of 3 or "NO" (without quotes) otherwise.

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 1000
2 ≤ K ≤ 1012
1 ≤ d0 ≤ 9
0 ≤ d1 ≤ 9

YES


Explanation
Example case 1: The whole number N is 34748, which is not divisible by 3, so the answer is NO.
Example case 2: The whole number N is 8198624862486, which is divisible by 3, so the answer is YES.
