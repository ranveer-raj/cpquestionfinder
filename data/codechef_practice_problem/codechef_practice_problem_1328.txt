SudokuX is a variation of the popular game Sudoku. Similar to standard Sudoku, in SudokuX, we have to enter the numbers 1 - 9 once in each row, column and 3 x 3 square within the 9x9 puzzle grid. In addition to standard Sudoku, the numbers must only occur once in each of the two diagonals.
Johnny is very interested in playing SudokuX. He believes that this game is so challenging that even the best computer programs could not solve it efficiently.
Let's show Johnny the power of computers by writing a program to solve even the hardest SudokuX puzzles within seconds!
Input
The first line contains t, the number of test cases (about 10). Then t test cases follow.
Each test case consists of 9 lines. Each line contains 9 characters '.' (blank grid), or '1'..'9' representing a SudokuX puzzle.
Each test case is separated by a blank line.
You are guaranteed that each given SudokuX puzzle has a unique solution.
Output
For each puzzle, output the solution in the same format as the input. Print a blank line after each test case.
