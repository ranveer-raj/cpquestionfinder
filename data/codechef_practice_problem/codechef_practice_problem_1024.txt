In the new world, we also have a new system called Cybalphabit system.
The system assigns points to each Latin lowercase alphabet as follows:-
'a' is assigned 2020 , 'b' is assigned 2121, 'c' 2222 and so on. Thus, finally 'z' is assigned 225225 points.
A Cyberstring is a sequence of lowercase Latin alphabets.
Now, the total score of a Cyberstring will be the sum of points of its characters.
You will be given two integers NN and KK. 
Construct a Cyberstring XX of length NN with total score KK or print −1−1 if it is not possible to form the Cyberstring (XX). 
If there are multiple answers, print any.
INPUT:

First line contains TT, the number of test cases.
Each of the next TT lines denotes a different test case :
The (i+1)th(i+1)th line denotes the ithith test case, and contains two integers NN and KK, the length of the string that is to be constructed, and the score of the string respectively. 

OUTPUT:

For each test case, provide the output on a different line.
Output the required string XX, if one exists, otherwise output −1−1.

Constraints:-

1≤T≤1051≤T≤105
1≤n≤1051≤n≤105
1≤k≤5∗1071≤k≤5∗107

The sum of nn over all test cases is less than 105105

Explanation
In the first test case, n=2n=2 and k=2k=2. So,we have to construct a string of length 22 with total score 22. It can be easily seen that the only possible string is "aa". Its total score will be equal to 20+20=220+20=2.
In the second case, "ac" will have score 20+22=520+22=5. Obviously, "ca" will also have the same score and is also a possible answer.
In the fourth test case, it can be shown that there is no possible string which satisfies the conditions.
