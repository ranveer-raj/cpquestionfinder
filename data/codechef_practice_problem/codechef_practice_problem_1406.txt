An array is said to be good if all its elements are distinct, i.e. no two elements of the array are equal to each other.
You are given a positive integer NN and an integer KK such that N≤K≤(N+12)N≤K≤(N+12).
Construct an array A of length N that satisfies the following conditions

A has exactly K good (contiguous) subarrays, and
Every element of A is an integer from 1 to N (both inclusive).

If there are multiple such arrays, you can print any of them.
Note: It can be shown that for all inputs satisfying the given constraints, there is always a valid solution.
Input Format

The first line contains an integer T, the number of testcases. The description of the T testcases follow.
Each testcase consists of a single line with two space separated integers, N and K respectively.

Output Format

For each testcase print N space separated integers, the elements of the constructed array.
If there are multiple outputs, you can print any of them.
Your output will be considered correct only if the following conditions are satisfied,
Every element of the array is between 1 and N, and
The array has exactly K good subarrays

Constraints

1≤T≤105
1≤N≤105
N≤K≤(N+12)
Sum of N over all testcases is atmost 3⋅105.

Explanation
Test Case 1: N=5,K=5. All subarrays of length 1 are good, therefore every array of size N has at least N good subarrays. If all elements are equal then these will be the only good subarrays so the given array {1,1,1,1,1} is a valid solution. Observe that under the constraints there are 5 different solutions (one for each value 1 through 5) and all of them will be considered correct.
Test Case 2: N=5,K=15. There are only (N+12)=15 subarrays, including the array itself. Therefore the array itself must be good which leads us to the solution given above. Any permutation of {1,2,3,4,5} is also a valid solution, thus there are 5!=120 different solutions to this case and all of them will be considered correct.
Test Case 3: N=5,K=7. The constructed array is A={1,2,2,1,1}. You may verify that the only good subarrays of A, in addition to the 5 subarrays of length 1, are those shown below (subarrays are highlighted red).

{1,2,2,1,1}
{1,2,2,1,1}
