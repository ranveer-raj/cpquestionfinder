A string S whose characters are one of the following 5: (, ), +, − and ?, is said to be a valid string if one of the following conditions holds:

S= ?
S=(x+y), where x and y are valid strings.
S=(x−y), where x and y are valid strings.

For example, strings ?, (?−?), (?+(?−?)) are valid strings, while strings (?−+), ??, (?), ?−?, (?+?)) are not.
The power of a valid string S is defined to be the maximum value attainable by replacing each ? in it by either 0 or 1 and evaluating the resulting expression.
For example, the power of (?−?) is 1 because we can obtain (1−0) which evaluates to 1.
You are given a valid string S, and Q queries on it. Each query is represented by two integers L and R (L≤R).
Your task is to find the power of the substring SL,SL+1,…,SR. It is guaranteed that this substring is a valid string.
Note: The input of this problem is large, so use fast input/output methods.
Input Format

The first line of input contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows:
The first line of each test case contains the string S.
The next line contains an integer Q, representing the number of queries to answer.
Each of the following Q lines contains two space-separated integers, L and R, representing the query.

Output Format
For each test case, print one line containing Q space-separated integers, the i-th of which represents the answer to the i-th query.

Explanation
Test case 1:

Query 1: Power of the string ? is 1, as it can be converted to 1.
Query 2: Power of the string (?+?) is 2, as it can be converted to (1+1).

Test case 2:

Query 1: Power of the string (?−(?−?)) is 2, as it can be converted to (1−(0−1)).
Query 2: Power of the string (?−?) is 1, as it can be converted to (1−0).

Test case 3:

Query 1: Power of the string (?−(?+?)) is 1, as it can be converted to (1−(0+0)).
