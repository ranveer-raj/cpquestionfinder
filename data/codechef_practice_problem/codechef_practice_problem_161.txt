Tonmoy has a special torch. The torch has 44 levels numbered 11 to 44 and 22 states (𝙾𝚗On and 𝙾𝚏𝚏Off). Levels 1,2,1,2, and 33 correspond to the 𝙾𝚗On state while level 44 corresponds to the 𝙾𝚏𝚏Off state. 
The levels of the torch can be changed as:

Level 11 changes to level 22.
Level 22 changes to level 33.
Level 33 changes to level 44.
Level 44 changes to level 11.

Given the initial state as KK and the number of changes made in the levels as NN, find the final state of the torch. If the final state cannot be determined, print 𝙰𝚖𝚋𝚒𝚐𝚞𝚘𝚞𝚜Ambiguous instead.
Input Format

First line will contain TT, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case contains of a single line of input, two integers N,KN,K - the number of changes made in the levels and initial state of the torch. Here, K=0K=0 denotes 𝙾𝚏𝚏Off state while K=1K=1 denotes 𝙾𝚗On state. 

Output Format
For each test case, output in a single line, the final state of the torch, i.e. 𝙾𝚗On or 𝙾𝚏𝚏Off. If the final state cannot be determined, print 𝙰𝚖𝚋𝚒𝚐𝚞𝚘𝚞𝚜Ambiguous instead.
You may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings 𝙾𝚗On, 𝙾𝙽ON, 𝚘𝚗on and 𝚘𝙽oN will all be treated as identical).

Explanation
Test Case 11: Initially, the torch is in 𝙾𝚏𝚏Off state. Since only level 44 corresponds to the 𝙾𝚏𝚏Off state, the torch is at level 44 initially. After 44 changes, the final level would be 44. Level 44 corresponds to the 𝙾𝚏𝚏Off state. Hence, finally the torch is 𝙾𝚏𝚏Off. 
Test Case 22: Initially, the torch is in 𝙾𝚗On state. After 00 changes, the torch remains in the 𝙾𝚗On state.
Test Case 33: Initially, the torch is in 𝙾𝚗On state. This can correspond to any of the first 33 levels. Thus, we cannot determine the final level after 33 changes. Hence, the final state is 𝙰𝚖𝚋𝚒𝚐𝚞𝚘𝚞𝚜Ambiguous.
