There are seven magical dragon balls in total scattered across the Earth. Upon collecting all seven of them, one can summon the divine dragon Shenron by chanting magical words. The dragon would then grant any one wish of the summoner.
Chef and his two friends Ramzz and Raju embarked on a journey to collect all seven magical dragon balls. After much difficulty, they have collected them all and proceeded to summon Shenron by chanting magical words. Upon arrival, Shenron told the three friends that he would grant their wish only if they solve the following problem.
You are given a sequence of integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN, on which you may perform operations of the following two types:

Choose two consecutive odd elements and replace them by a single element ― their sum. For example, the sequence [1,2,3⎯⎯,3⎯⎯,4][1,2,3_,3_,4] may be changed to [1,2,6⎯⎯,4][1,2,6_,4] (the replaced elements are underlined).
Choose two consecutive even elements and replace them by a single element ― their sum plus 11. For example, the sequence [1,2⎯⎯,2⎯⎯,3,4][1,2_,2_,3,4] may be changed to [1,5⎯⎯,3,4][1,5_,3,4].

Your goal is to create a sequence whose length is the smallest possible. If there are multiple sequences with this minimum length, find the most beautiful one among them. (A sequence A1,A2,…,AMA1,A2,…,AM is more beautiful than a sequence B1,B2,…,BMB1,B2,…,BM if there is a valid index ii such that Ai<BiAi<Bi and for each valid j<ij<i, Aj=BjAj=Bj.)
Help Chef and his friends Ramzz and Raju solve Shenron's problem.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer NN.
The second line contains NN space-separated integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN.

Output
For each test case, print two lines.

The first of these lines should contain a single integer KK ― the smallest possible length of the final sequence.
The second line should contain KK space-separated integers ― the most beautiful final sequence with length KK.

Constraints

1≤T≤1001≤T≤100
1≤N≤1051≤N≤105
0≤Ai≤1060≤Ai≤106 for each valid ii
the sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 106106

Subtasks
Subtask #1 (50 points): A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN are either all odd or all even
Subtask #2 (50 points): original constraints
