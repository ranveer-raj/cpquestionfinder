Uneori îmi spun: am să mor
atât de singuratecă-n mijlocul lor;
limba simplă a bucuriilor n-am învâțat;
am să mor ca o pasăre care prea mult a zburat,
dar n-a făcut cuib nicăieri.
― Oamenii ma uimesc, Magda Isafost

As of writing the informal statement, the winter just came and the statement was in season. Now, it is not winter anymore, so here is the formal statement instead:
You are given a connected graph with NN nodes and MM edges. You are given QQ queries of the following types:

1 u𝟷 𝚞: Given node u (1≤u≤N), set the state of the node u to frozen.
2 t: Given t, let t units of time pass by.
3 v: Given node v (1≤v≤N), answer if node v is currently frozen.

Initially, no node is frozen.
The graph has the following property:

If, at time T, a node u is frozen, then, at time (T+1), all neighbours of u become frozen.

For each query of type 3, answer whether the node is currently frozen. 
Note:

If a node is already frozen, it remains unaffected after a type 1 query.
If, for a frozen node u, a neighbour v of node u is frozen at time T, node v remains unaffected at time (T+1).

Input Format

The first line of input contains three integers N,M, and Q.
M lines follow, the ith of which contains two integers ui and vi, representing there is an edge between nodes ui and vi.
Then, Q lines follow, the jth of which contains two integers typej and xj.
If typej is 1 or 2, it indicates that you must effectuate an update of the type typej with parameter xj. Otherwise, answer the query with parameter xj

Output Format
For each query of type 3, print YES if the queried node is frozen. Otherwise, print NO. 
You may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings YeS, yEs, yes and YES will all be treated as identical).
Constraints

1≤N,Q≤105
1≤M≤3⋅105
1≤ui,vi≤N
1≤typej≤3
1≤xj≤N, if the query type is 1 or 3.
1≤xj≤109, if the query type is 2.

Subtasks

Subtask 1 (10 points): 1≤N≤1000,1≤Q≤2000,1≤M≤3000.
Subtask 2 (30 points): Each node in the given graph has at most two neighbours.   
Subtask 3 (60 points): Original constraints.

YES
YES
NO


Explanation
Test Case 1: The graph looks like:


Query 1: Freeze the node 1. The graph looks like:

Query 2: Find the status of node 1. Since node 1 is frozen, we print YES.
Query 3: Freeze the node 5. The graph looks like:

Query 4: 1 unit of time passes. Before this, nodes 1 and 5 were frozen.
After 1 second, all the neighbours of node 1, i.e., nodes 2,4, and 6, and all the neighbours of node 5, i.e., nodes 4 and 6 are frozen.
Thus, after this query, the frozen nodes in the graph are 1,2,4,5, and 6. The graph looks like:

Query 5: Find the status of node 4. Since node 4 is frozen, we print YES.
Query 6: Find the status of node 3. Since node 3 is not frozen, we print NO.
