You are given two positive integers aa and bb. You also have a number xx, which is initially set to 0. At first, you can add a to x any number of times. After that, you can divide x by b any number of times as long as x is divisible by b.
Print YES if you can make x equal to 1, otherwise print NO.
Input Format

First line of input will contain T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case contains a single line, two positive integers a,b.

Output Format
For each test case, output on one line YES if it is possible to make x , or NO if it is not possible to do so. 
Output is case insensitive, which means that "yes", "Yes", "YEs", "no", "nO" - all such strings will be acceptable.
Constraints

1≤T≤100000
1≤a,b≤109

Explanation
Test case 2: We initially have x set to 0. Add a=9 to x for 4 times to make x equal to 36. And then divide x by b=6 for 2 times to make x equal to 1.
Test case 4: We initially have x set to 0. Add a=8 to x for 18 times to make x equal to 144. And then divide x by b=12 for 2 times to make x equal to 1.
