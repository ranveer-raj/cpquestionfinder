Let f be a permutation of length N, where N is even. The riffle of f is defined to be the permutation
g=(f(1),f(3),…,f(N−1),f(2),f(4),…,f(N))
You are given two integers N and K. Output the resultant permutation when you riffle the identity permutation of length N, K times.
The identity permutation of length N is σN=(1,2,…,N)
Input Format

The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
Each test case consists of a single line of input, containing two space-separated integers N and K.

Output Format
For each test case, output the answer permutation as N space-separated integers in a new line.
Constraints

1≤T≤100
1≤N≤3⋅105
1≤K≤109
N is even
The sum of N across test cases does not exceed 3⋅105

Subtasks

Subtask 1 (30 points): N is a power of 2

Explanation
Test case 1: Performing the riffle on σ6=(1,2,3,4,5,6) once results in (1,3,5,2,4,6), by definition.
Test case 2: The process goes as follows:

Performing the riffle on (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8) results in (1,3,5,7,2,4,6,8)
Performing the riffle on (1,3,5,7,2,4,6,8) results in (1,5,2,6,3,7,4,8)
