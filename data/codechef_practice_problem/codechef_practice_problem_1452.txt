An optimist believes in the optimal usage of all options available.
Chef gives you a sequence A1,A2,…,AN consisting of integers. You can perform the following operation on the sequence any number of times (possibly 0):

Select any continuous segment Al…r and sort the segment in non-descending order, while keeping other elements unchanged. The cost to perform this operation is max(Al…r)−min(Al…r). 

For example, if the sequence A=[3,4,1,5,1,9], then applying the operation on A2…5 yields the sequence [3,1,1,4,5,9]. The cost to perform this operation is 5−1=4 .
You have to determine the minimum total cost of operations so that the sequence A becomes sorted in non-descending order, which means for all 2≤i≤N, the condition Ai−1≤Ai is satisfied.
Input Format

The first line of the input contains a single integer T - the number of test cases. The test cases then follow.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.

Output Format

For each test case, print the minimum total cost of operations so that the sequence A becomes sorted in non-descending order.

Constraints

1≤T≤105
1≤N≤105
1≤Ai≤109
Sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105

Subtasks

Subtask 1 (20 points): N≤1000; ΣN≤2000
Subtask 2 (40 points): A is a permutation from 1 to N
Subtask 3 (40 points): Original constraints

Explanation

Test case 1: The sequence is already sorted in non-descending order. So, we require 0 operations and thus 0 total cost.
Test case 2: We can apply the operation on A1…3 which converts A into [1,4,10] which is sorted in non-descending order.
So, the total cost is 10−1=9. It can be shown that we can't sort A with less than 9 total cost.
Test Case 3: First, we can apply the operation on A1…4 which converts A into [1,3,3,3,4,3].
Then, apply the operation on A3…6 which converts A into [1,3,3,3,3,4] which is sorted in non-descending order.
So, the total cost is 3−1+4−3=3. It can be shown that we can't sort A with less than 3 total cost.
