You are given a sequence A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN and you have to perform the following operation exactly XX times:

Choose two integers ii and jj such that 1≤i<j≤N1≤i<j≤N.
Choose a non-negative integer pp.
Change AiAi to Ai⊕2pAi⊕2p, and change AjAj to Aj⊕2pAj⊕2p, where ⊕⊕ denotes bitwise XOR.

Find the lexicographically smallest sequence which can be obtained by performing this operation exactly XX times.
A sequence B1,B2,…,BNB1,B2,…,BN is said to be lexicographically smaller than a sequence C1,C2,…,CNC1,C2,…,CN if there is an index ii such that Bi<CiBi<Ci and for each valid j<ij<i, Bj=CjBj=Cj.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN and XX. 
The second line contains NN space-separated integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing NN space-separated integers ― the lexicographically smallest obtainable sequence.

Explanation
Example case 1: The original sequence is (2,2,3)(2,2,3). Consider the following three operations:

Choose i=1i=1, j=2j=2 and p=1p=1. Then, A1A1 changes from 22 to 2⊕21=02⊕21=0 and similarly, A2A2 changes from 22 to 2⊕21=02⊕21=0. Now the sequence is (0,0,3)(0,0,3).
Next, choose i=1i=1, j=2j=2 and p=1p=1. Then, A1A1 changes to 0⊕21=20⊕21=2 and A2A2 changes to 0⊕21=20⊕21=2. The sequence is (2,2,3)(2,2,3).
Next, again choose i=1i=1, j=2j=2 and p=1p=1. Then, A1A1 changes to 2⊕21=02⊕21=0 and A2A2 changes to 2⊕21=02⊕21=0. The sequence is (0,0,3)(0,0,3) again.

We can check that after exactly 3 operations, this is the lexicographically smallest sequence we can obtain.
