You are given an array AA of NN integers . You want to convert the array AA into a permutation of N integers. To do this, you can apply the following operation on array A exactly once .

Pick an integer X, where 1≤X≤2⋅107. For each i , 1≤i≤N , replace Ai by Ai%X.

Find out whether it is possible to convert A into a permutation of N integers. If it is possible, print YES (all uppercase alphabets) and any possible value of X for which it is possible. Otherwise, print NO (all uppercase alphabets).
Note - An array of N integers is called a permutation if it contains all integers from 1  to N exactly once.
Input Format

The first line contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The T test cases then follow.
The first line of each test case contains an integer N.
The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.

Output Format
For each testcase, output the required answer in a single line. If an answer exists, print YES and an integer X (1≤X≤2⋅107) separated by a single space. Otherwise, print NO.
Note that the strings are case-sensitive and must be in uppercase alphabets.
Constraints

1≤T≤100
1≤N≤105
1≤Ai≤107
Sum of N over all cases won't exceed 105

                        Sample Output 1
                        





YES 4
NO


Explanation

In the first case, choosing X=4 yields A as [2%4,7%4,1%4]=[2,3,1] which is a permutation of N=3.
In the second case, we can't make Ai = 1 for any i and for any value of X.
