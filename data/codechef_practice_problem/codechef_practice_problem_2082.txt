You are given a sequence A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN. For each kk (1≤k≤N), let's define a function f(k) in the following way:

Consider a sequence B1,B2,…,BN, which is created by setting Ak=0. Formally, Bk=0 and Bi=Ai for each valid i≠k.
f(k) is the number of ways to split the sequence B into two non-empty contiguous subsequences with equal sums.

Find the sum S=f(1)+f(2)+…+f(N).
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the sum S.
Constraints

1≤T≤10
2≤N≤2⋅105
1≤|Ai|≤109 for each valid i
