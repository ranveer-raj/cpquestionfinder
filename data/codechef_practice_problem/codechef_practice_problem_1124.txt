Gru wants to distribute NN bananas to KK minions on his birthday.
Gru does not like to just give everyone the same number of bananas, so instead, he wants to distribute bananas in such a way that each minion gets a distinct amount of bananas. That is, no two minions should get the same number of bananas.
Gru also loves gcd. The higher the gcd, the happier Gru and the minions get. So help Gru in distributing the bananas in such a way that each Minion gets a distinct amount of bananas and gcd of this distribution is highest possible. Output this maximum gcd. If such a distribution is not possible output −1.
Note: You have to distribute all N bananas. 
Input:

First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
Each testcase consists of a single line of input, which has two integers: N,K. 

Output:
For each testcase, output in a single line the maximum gcd or -1.
Constraints

1≤T≤100
1≤N,K≤109


                        Sample Input 1
                        





1
6 3



                        Sample Output 1
                        





1


Explanation
The only possible distribution is [1,2,3]. So the answer is 1.
