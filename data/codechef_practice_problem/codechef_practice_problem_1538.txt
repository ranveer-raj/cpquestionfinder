Chef has an array of NN integers [A1,A2,…,AN][A1,A2,…,AN]. He wants to perform M operations; for each i (1≤i≤M), the i-th operation consists of reversing the subarray [Ali,…,Ari].
Each operation should be applied exactly once. However, Chef does not remember the order in which they should be applied, so he wants to choose a uniformly random permutation of the M operations and apply them in that order.
Let's denote by B the resulting array if the operations are unpermuted, i.e. applied in the order 1 through M. Find the probability that the resulting array (after Chef applies all operations in a random order) is equal to B. Specifically, this probability can be expressed as a fraction P/Q, where P and Q are coprime positive integers; compute P and Q.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and M.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.
M lines follow. For each valid i, the i-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers li and ri.

Output
Print a single line containing two integers P and Q, separated by a slash (the character '/').
