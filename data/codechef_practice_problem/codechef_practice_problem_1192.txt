You are given an integer sequence A with length N. Find the number of ordered pairs of positive integers (a,b) such that a occurs in A at least b times and b occurs in A at least a times. 
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the number of pairs.
