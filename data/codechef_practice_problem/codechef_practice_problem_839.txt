Vanja and Miksi have already finished everything for this year at their university, so they decided to spend their free time playing a game with a binary sequence A1,A2,…,AN (i.e. a sequence containing only integers 0 and 1).
At the beginning of the game, Vanja and Miksi write down the expression ∗A1∗A2∗A3∗…∗AN (note below that each ∗ is a placeholder and does not denote multiplication).
The players take turns alternately, starting with Vanja. The game lasts N turns. In each turn, the current player must replace the first (leftmost) remaining ∗ by the sign + or − (or, equivalently, by the operation of addition or subtraction).
After the last turn, the boys calculate the resulting value V of the expression. If |V|≥K, the winner is Vanja; otherwise, the winner is Miksi.
Please predict the winner of the game if both players play optimally. 
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and K.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — 1 if Vanja (the first player) is the winner or 2 if Miksi (the second player) is the winner.

Explanation
Example case 1: K=1, so if Vanja replaces the first ∗ by +, the value of the final expression will be V=1; then, K≤|V|, so the winner is Vanja.
Example case 2: K=5, but the absolute value of the final expression cannot be greater than 1. The winner is Miksi.
