The integers 00 to M−1M−1 have been arranged in a circular fashion. That is, 0,1,2,…,M−10,1,2,…,M−1, are in that order and
also, 0 and M−1 are next to each other. The distance between any two adjacent numbers on this circle is 1. You are given N intervals on this, such that no two intervals touch or intersect with each other. The i-th interval will be of the form [Li,Ri]. This means that the i-th interval contains all the integers between Li and Ri, both end points inclusive. You are supposed to mark exactly one number inside each interval, in such a way that the minimum distance between any two marked numbers is maximized.
More formally, we have 0≤L1≤R1<L2≤R2<L3…<LN≤RN≤M−1. You are supposed to mark exactly N numbers: A1,A2,…,AN, such that Li≤Ai≤Ri for all 1≤i≤N. And you want to do it in such a manner mini≠j (shortest distance between Ai and Aj ), is maximized.
Input:

First line of the input contains a pair of integers M and N.
The i-th of the next N lines contains two numbers Li and Ri which denote the end points of the i-th interval.

Output:

A single integer denoting the maximized minimum distance between any two marked numbers.

3


Explanation
We can choose A1=0,A2=3,A3=6. The distance between every adjacent marked pair of numbers is 3, and hence that is the minimum. You can check that you cannot do any better, and hence 3 is the answer.
