A company conducted a coding test to hire candidates. NN candidates appeared for the test, and each of them faced MM problems. Each problem was either unsolved by a candidate (denoted by 'U'), solved partially (denoted by 'P'), or solved completely (denoted by 'F'). 
To pass the test, each candidate needs to either solve XX or more problems completely, or solve (X−1)(X−1) problems completely, and YY or more problems partially.
Given the above specifications as input, print a line containing NN integers. The ithith integer should be 11 if the ithith candidate has passed the test, else it should be 00.
Input:

The first line of the input contains an integer TT, denoting the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers, NN and MM, denoting the number of candidates who appeared for the test, and the number of problems in the test, respectively.
The second line of each test case contains two space-separated integers, XX and YY, as described above, respectively.
The next NN lines contain MM characters each. The jthjth character of the ithith line denotes the result of the ithith candidate in the jthjth problem. 'F' denotes that the problem was solved completely, 'P' denotes partial solve, and 'U' denotes that the problem was not solved by the candidate.

Output:
For each test case, print a single line containing NN integers. The ithith  integer denotes the result of the ithith candidate. 11 denotes that the candidate passed the test, while 00 denotes that he/she failed the test.

Explanation

Sample Test 1: There are 44 candidates and 55 problems. Each candidate needs to solve 33 or more problems completely, or 22 problems completely and 22 or more problems partially. Only the first and the second candidates satisfy this.
Sample Test 2: The candidates need to either solve at least one problem completely, or they need to solve three or more problems partially. Only candidates 11 and 33 satisfy this.
Sample Test 3: The candidate needs to either solve two or more problems completely, or solve at least one problems completely and two problems partially. The candidate does not satisfy this.
