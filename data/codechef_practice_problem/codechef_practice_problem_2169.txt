You are given a tree with NN vertices (numbered 11 through NN) and a sequence of integers A1,A2,…,AN. You may choose an arbitrary permutation p1,p2,…,pN of the integers 1 through N. Then, for each vertex i, you should assign the value Api to this vertex.
The profit of a path between two vertices u and v is the sum of the values assigned to the vertices on that path (including u and v).
Let's consider only (undirected) paths that start at a leaf and end at a different leaf. Calculate the maximum possible value of the sum of profits of all such paths. Since this value could be very large, compute it modulo 109+7.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.
Each of the following N−1 lines contains two space-separated integers u and v denoting that vertices u and v are connected by an edge.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the maximum sum of profits, modulo 109+7.
Constraints

1≤T≤1,000
1≤N≤300,000
1≤Ai≤109 for each valid i
the sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 5⋅105

Explanation
Example case 1: (1,4,2,3) is one of the possible permutations that give the optimal answer. Then, the profits of paths between pairs of vertices (1,3), (1,4) and (3,4) are 7, 8 and 9 respectively.
Example case 2: Here, any permutation could be chosen.
