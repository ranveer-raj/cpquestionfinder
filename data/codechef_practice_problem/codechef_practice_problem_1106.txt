Bob has n heap(s) of gravel (initially there are exactly c piece(s) in each). He wants to do m operation(s) with that heaps, each maybe:
adding pieces of gravel onto the heaps from u to v, exactly k pieces for each,
or querying "how many pieces of gravel are there in the heap p now?".
Request
Help Bob do operations of the second type.
Input

The first line contains the integers n,m,c, respectively.
m following lines, each forms:
S u v k to describe an operation of the first type.
Q p to describe an operation of the second type.
(Each integer on a same line, or between the characters S, Q and the integers is separated by at least one space character)
Output
For each operation of the second type, output (on a single line) an integer answering to the respective query (follows the respective Input order).
Limitations
0<n≤106
0<m≤250 000
0<u≤v≤n
0≤c,k≤109
0<p≤n
