Rafid is teaching his students plane geometry. Today they are talking about convex polygons. A convex polygon is a simple non-degenerate polygon such that each of its internal angles is strictly smaller than 180∘180∘.
Rafid drew NN points (numbered 11 through NN) on a blackboard (a two-dimensional plane) and told each student to choose some of the points and connect them to obtain a convex polygon. For each valid ii, the coordinates of the ii-th point are (Xi,Yi)(Xi,Yi).
There are KK students (numbered 11 through KK). To prevent the students from choosing the same polygon over and over, Rafid told them that they have to choose polygons one by one in the order from student 11 to student KK and each student has to choose a set of points which was not chosen by any earlier student. That means they have to choose KK different sets of points, resulting in KK different polygons. As a result, some students may end up unable to choose any polygon.
To encourage the students, Rafid announced that each student will receive a number of candies proportional to the area of this student's polygon. The students are very greedy, so the first student will choose the polygon with the largest area, the second student will choose the polygon with the largest area which does not use the same set of points as the first student's polygon, and so on.
For each student, help Rafid find the area of the polygon chosen by this student or determine that this student cannot choose a polygon anymore. Note that while there may be many ways in which the students could choose their polygons, their areas are uniquely determined.
Input

The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers NN and KK.
NN lines follow. For each valid ii, the ii-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers XiXi and YiYi.

Output
Print a single line containing KK space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AKA1,A2,…,AK. For each valid ii, AiAi should be twice the area of a polygon chosen by the ii-th student, or −1−1 if all possible polygons have already been chosen by students before the ii-th student.

Explanation
The following figure describes the points and some polygons.


The first student chooses the largest polygon 𝖠𝖡𝖢𝖣ABCD with area 100100.
The next four students choose the triangles 𝖠𝖡𝖢ABC, 𝖡𝖢𝖣BCD, 𝖢𝖣𝖠CDA and 𝖣𝖠𝖡DAB, each with area 5050. Note that for example, the polygon 𝖠𝖤𝖢𝖡AECB is not convex because it has one internal angle equal to 180∘180∘.
The next four students choose the triangles 𝖠𝖤𝖡AEB, 𝖡𝖤𝖢BEC, 𝖢𝖤𝖣CED and 𝖣𝖤𝖠DEA, each with area 2525.
There are no more polygons the students can choose, so the remaining six students are left without a polygon.
