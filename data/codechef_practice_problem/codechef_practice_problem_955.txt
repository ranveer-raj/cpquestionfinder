You are given a set of N strings S0, S1, …, SN-1. These strings consist of only lower case characters a..z and have the same length L. 

A string H is said to be K-important if there are at least K strings in the given set of N strings appearing at K different positions in H. These K strings need not to be distinct.

Your task is to find the shortest K-important string. If there are more than one possible solution, your program can output any of them.

Input
The first line contains a number t (about 10) which is the number of test cases.

Each test case has the following form.

The first line contains three integers N, L and K. The next N lines contain the strings in the given set.

Each test case's input is separated by a blank line.

Constraints
1 ≤ N ≤ 150
1 ≤ L ≤ 300
1 ≤ K ≤ 500
Output
For each test case, output the following information. The first line contains the length of the shortest K-important strings. 
The second line contains H, one of the K-important strings. 
Each line in the next K lines contains the index of one string in the given set that appears in H and the corresponding position (0-based) in H.

Print a blank line after each test case's output.
