You are given a sequence A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN. Chef wants you to handle QQ queries. There are two types of queries:

1 L R X: for each ii (L≤i≤R), add (X+i−L)2 to Ai
2 Y: find the current value of AY

Input

The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers N and Q.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.
Q lines follow. Each of these lines describes a query in the format described above.

Output
For each query of the second type, print a single line containing one integer AY.
Constraints

1≤N,Q≤105
0≤|Ai|≤106 for each valid i
1≤L≤R≤N
0≤|X|≤106
1≤Y≤N

                        Sample Output 1
                        





52
69


Explanation

the sequence after the first query is [1+52,10+(5+2−1)2,3+(5+3−1)2,6,5]=[26,46,52,6,5]
the second query asks for A3, which is 52
the sequence after the third query is [26,46,52,6+72,5+(7+1)2]=[26,46,52,55,69]
the fourth query asks for A5, which is 69
