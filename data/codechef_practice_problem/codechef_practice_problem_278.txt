There are NN seats in a row. You are given a string SS with length NN; for each valid ii, the ii-th character of SS is '0' if the ii-th seat is empty or '1' if there is someone sitting in that seat.
Two people are friends if they are sitting next to each other. Two friends are always part of the same group of friends. Can you find the total number of groups? 
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single string SS. 

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the number of groups.

Explanation
Example case 1: Since all seats are empty, the number of groups is 00.
Example case 2: Since only one seat is occupied, the number of groups is 11.
Example case 3: Here, two seats are occupied, but since they are not adjacent, the people sitting on them belong to different groups.
Example case 4: Here, we have 44 groups of friends with size 11, 22, 22 and 44 respectively. That is, first group is sitting at 22nd seat, second group at 44th and 55th seat, third group at  77th and 88th seat and fourth group at 1010th to 1313th seat.
