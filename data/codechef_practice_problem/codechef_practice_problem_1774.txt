The alternating sum of an array A=[A1,A2,…,AN] is defined to be
A1−A2+A3−…+(−1)N−1AN
You are allowed to perform the following operation at most once on A:

Choose a subarray of A of odd length, remove this subarray from the original array, and concatenate it at the end of the remaining array. In other words, pick 1≤L≤R≤N such that R−L+1 is odd, and transform A into the array [A1,A2,…,AL−1,AR+1,…,AN,AL,AL+1,…,AR].

For example, if the original array is [1,2,3,4,5], two possible moves are:

Choose the subarray [1] and move it to the end to obtain [2,3,4,5,1]
Choose the subarray [2,3,4] and move it to the end to obtain [1,5,2,3,4]

Given that you can perform this operation at most once, what is the maximum possible alternating sum the resulting array can achieve?
Input Format

The first line contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N, denoting the number of elements in A.
The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN, the elements of A.

Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the maximum possible alternating sum obtainable after performing the given operation at most once.
Constraints

1≤T≤105
3≤N≤105
1≤Ai≤109
The sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 106.

Explanation

Test Case 1: Move subarray [5] to the end to obtain the array [1,2,5]. The alternating sum of this array is 1−2+5=4, and no larger is possible.
Test Case 2: Move subarray [1] starting at index 1 to the end to obtain the array [10,1,5,2,1]. The alternating sum of this array is 10−1+5−2+1=13, and no larger is possible.
