Chef has two integers A and B. He can perform the following operation on A an arbitrary number of times (including zero):

write A as a binary number with an arbitrary number of leading zeroes (possibly without any)
shuffle the binary digits of A in an arbitrary way, obtaining a number s
replace A by s+1

Chef is wondering about the minimum number of operations he has to perform on A in order to obtain B. Compute this number or determine that it is impossible.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers A and B. 

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the minimum number of operations or −1 if it is impossible to obtain B from A.
Constraints

1≤T≤105
0≤A,B≤1018

Subtasks
Subtask #1 (20 points): A,B≤27
Subtask #2 (80 points): original constraints

1


Explanation
Example case 1: One optimal solution is to not shuffle anything, so Chef just adds 1 twice. 
Example case 2: We can obtain 5 from 1 in one operation.
