Chef loves games! But he likes to invent his own. Now he plays game "Digit Jump". Chef has a sequence of digits S1,S2,…,SNS1,S2,…,SN. He is staying in the first digit S1S1 and wants to reach the last digit SNSN in the minimal number of jumps. 
While staying in some index i Chef can jump into i−1 and i+1, but he can't jump out from sequence. Or he can jump into any digit with the same value Si. 
Help Chef to find the minimal number of jumps he need to reach digit SN from digit S1. 
Input
Input contains a single line consist of string S of length N - the sequence of digits.
Output
In a single line print single integer - the minimal number of jumps he needs.
Constraints

1≤N≤105
Each symbol of S is a digit from 0 to 9.
