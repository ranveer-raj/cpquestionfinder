In the magical land of Byteland, there are three kinds of citizens:

a Bit - 2ms2ms after a Bit appears, it grows up and becomes a Nibble (i.e. it disappears and a Nibble appears)
a Nibble - 8ms8ms after a Nibble appears, it grows up and becomes a Byte
a Byte - 16ms16ms after a Byte appears, it grows up, splits into two Bits and disappears

Chef wants to know the answer to the following question: what would the population of Byteland be immediately before the time NmsNms if only 1 Bit appeared at time 0ms0ms?
Help him and find the population (number of citizens) of each type.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer NN. 

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing three space-separated integers — the number of Bits, Nibbles and Bytes.

Explanation
Immediately before the time 2ms2ms, there is only one Bit. At 2ms2ms, this Bit grows up, so immediately before 3ms3ms, there is only one Nibble in Byteland.
