Explanation
Denoting Meliodas as M, Ban as B.
Testcase 1:
M=5, B=3
Ban eates 3 chocolates of Meliodas.
M=2, B=3
Meliodas eats 2 chocolates of Ban.
M=2, B=1
Ban eates 1 chocolate of Meliodas.
M=1, B=1
Since they have the same no of candies, they stop quarreling.
Total candies left: 2  
Testcase 2:
M=10, B=10
Since both of them had the same candies to begin with, there was no point in fighting.
Total candies left: 20  
Testcase 3:
M=4, B=8
Meliodas eats 4 chocolates of Ban.
M=4, B=4
Since they have the same no of candies, they stop quarreling.
Total candies left: 8
