You are given two integers NN and KK. You may perform the following operation any number of times (including zero): change NN to N−KN−K, i.e. subtract KK from NN. Find the smallest non-negative integer value of NN you can obtain this way.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN and KK.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the smallest value you can get.

Explanation
Example case 1:

First, we change N=5N=5 to N−K=5−2=3N−K=5−2=3.
Then, we have N=3N=3 and we change it to N−K=3−2=1N−K=3−2=1.

Since 1<K1<K, the process stops here and the smallest value is 11.
Example case 2: We change N=4N=4 to N−K=4−4=0N−K=4−4=0. Since 0<K0<K, the process stops here and the smallest value is 00.
Example case 3: Since 2<K2<K initially, we should not perform any operations and the smallest value is 22.
