Value of an array AA of length LL is defined as the sum of (Ai⊕i)(Ai⊕i) for all 0≤i<L0≤i<L, where ⊕⊕ denotes bitwise xor operation. Note that array indices start from zero.
You are given an integer NN and an array AA consisting of 2N2N integers where Ai=iAi=i for all 0≤i<2N0≤i<2N.
Example :

For N=1N=1, you have an array AA of length 21=221=2 and A=[0,1]A=[0,1].
For N=2N=2, you have an array AA of length 22=422=4 and A=[0,1,2,3]A=[0,1,2,3].

You can do at most KK operations on this array. In one operation, you can choose two indices ii and jj (0≤i,j<2N0≤i,j<2N) and swap AiAi and AjAj (i.e. AiAi becomes AjAj and vice versa). 
What is the maximum value of array AA you can obtain after at most KK operations? 
Input Format

Explanation

In the first test case, for N=2N=2, you have the array A=[0,1,2,3]A=[0,1,2,3]. No swap operation is 
allowed hence value of array A=(0⊕0)+(1⊕1)+(2⊕2)+(3⊕3)=0+0+0+0=0A=(0⊕0)+(1⊕1)+(2⊕2)+(3⊕3)=0+0+0+0=0. 
In the second test case, initially the array A=[0,1,2,3]A=[0,1,2,3]. If you swap A1A1 and A2A2, AA becomes [0,2,1,3][0,2,1,3]. Now value of array A=(0⊕0)+(2⊕1)+(1⊕2)+(3⊕3)=0+3+3+0=6A=(0⊕0)+(2⊕1)+(1⊕2)+(3⊕3)=0+3+3+0=6. There is no possible way such that value of array AA becomes greater than 66 using one swap operation.
