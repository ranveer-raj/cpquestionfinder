Chef's friend JJ challenged him to construct a tree which has exactly R red coloured nodes, G green coloured nodes and B blue coloured nodes.
To make the task interesting he added an extra condition: the simple path between any two blue nodes should contain at least one red node and at least one green node.
Can you help Chef to complete JJ's challenge by constructing any valid tree that satisfies these conditions? 
Input Format

The first line contains T - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains R, G, and B - the number of red, green and blue nodes respectively in the tree.

Output Format

If a tree can be constructed that fulfils all the requirements then
In the first line, output a string of length R+G+B in which the ith character (1-based indexing) is either R, G or B denoting the colour of the ith node as red, green or blue respectively.
In the following R+G+B−1 lines, output two integers U and V denoting there is an edge between Uth and Vth node.
If no tree fulfils the requirements print -1 in a single line. 

Constraints

1≤T≤100
3≤R+G+B≤1000
R,G,B≥1

Explanation

Test case 1: There is only one blue node. Hence, any valid tree with 1 red, 1 green and 1 blue node will pass the conditions.
Test case 2: There are two blue nodes numbered 1 and 4 and the simple path between them passes through one red node numbered 2 and one green node numbered 3. Hence, this tree is valid. 
Test case 3: No valid tree can be constructed under the given constraints.
