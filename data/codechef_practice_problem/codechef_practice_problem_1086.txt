You were strolling outside the restaurant at the end of the universe. On a metaspiral path you stumble upon a weird device which takes a three-digit number as input and processes it. The Hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy explains that it processes the input in the following manner: 

Multiplies it with 13, followed by 11 and then 7          
Outputs all the distinct three-digit numbers possible from the digits of the new number (each digit can only be used once)          

Your friend Zaphod is in a playful mood, and does the following with the device-           

Given a three-digit positive number K, he feeds it to the device for processing.          
He then takes the numbers it gives as output, and send each of them through the device and again collect all the numbers sent out.          
Repeats the above step N times.          

To test your wit, he challenges you to find the number of distinct 3-digit numbers which the device outputs over the N steps. Can you?
Input:

First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
Each testcase contains of a single line of input, two integers K,N.

Output:
For each testcase, output a single integer denoting the number of distinct 3-digit numbers which the device outputs over the N steps.
Constraints

1≤T≤1000 
5≤N≤109 
Each digit of K is non-zero
