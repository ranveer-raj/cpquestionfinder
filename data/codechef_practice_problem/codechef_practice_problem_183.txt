A great deal of energy is lost as metabolic heat when the organisms from one trophic level are consumed by the next level. 
Suppose in Chefland the energy reduces by a factor of KK, i.e, if initially, the energy is XX, then the transfer of energy to the next tropic level is ⌊XK⌋⌊XK⌋. This limits the length of foodchain which is defined to be the highest level receiving non-zero energy.
EE is the energy at the lowest tropic level. Given EE and KK for an ecosystem, find the maximum length of foodchain.
Note: ⌊x⌋⌊x⌋ denoted the floor function, and it returns the greatest integer that is less than or equal to xx (i.e  rounds down to the nearest integer). For example, ⌊1.4⌋=1⌊1.4⌋=1, ⌊5⌋=5⌊5⌋=5, ⌊−1.5⌋=−2⌊−1.5⌋=−2, ⌊−3⌋=−3⌊−3⌋=−3 , ⌊0⌋=0⌊0⌋=0.

Explanation
TestCase 11: The energy at first level is 55 units. For the second level energy becomes ⌊53⌋=1⌊53⌋=1 units. So the length of foodchain is 22 since from the next level onwards 00 units of energy will be received.
TestCase 33: The energy at different levels is:

Level 11- 1010 units
Level 22- ⌊102⌋=5⌊102⌋=5 units
Level 33- ⌊52⌋=2⌊52⌋=2 units
Level 44- ⌊22⌋=1⌊22⌋=1 units
Level 55- ⌊12⌋=0⌊12⌋=0 units

So the answer is 44, since it is the last level to receive non-zero energy.
