Consider a sequence A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN, where initially, Ai=iAi=i for each valid ii. You may perform any number of operations on this sequence (including zero). In one operation, you should choose two valid indices ii and jj, compute the greatest common divisor of AiAi and AjAj (let's denote it by gg), and change both AiAi and AjAj to gg.
You are given a sequence B1,B2,…,BNB1,B2,…,BN. Is it possible to obtain this sequence, i.e. change AA to BB, using the given operations?
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer NN.
The second line contains NN space-separated integers B1,B2,…,BNB1,B2,…,BN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing the string "YES" if it is possible to obtain A=BA=B or "NO" if it is impossible.
Constraints

1≤N≤1041≤N≤104
1≤Bi≤i1≤Bi≤i for each valid ii
the sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 105105

Subtasks
Subtask #1 (10 points): N≤4N≤4
Subtask #2 (20 points): there is at most one valid index pp such that Bp≠pBp≠p
Subtask #3 (70 points): original constraints

NO
YES


Explanation
Example case 1: We cannot make the third element of the sequence (1,2,3)(1,2,3) become 22.
Example case 2: We can perform one operation with (i,j)=(2,4)(i,j)=(2,4), which changes the sequence (1,2,3,4)(1,2,3,4) to (1,2,3,2)(1,2,3,2).
