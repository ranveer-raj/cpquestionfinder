Given NN points in a 2D2D space, find the minimum sum of areas of rectangles required to cover all the points given that we can use at most 22 non-overlapping rectangles whose sides can touch. The rectangles must be axis-aligned, meaning the sides are vertical and horizontal.
Input

The first line contains an integer TT, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. 
Each test case contains N+1 lines of input.
The first line contains a single integer N, the number of points. 
The next N lines each contains two integers xi, yi, the coordinates of the i-th point.

Note: Points need not be distinct.
Output
For each test case, output in a single line the answer to the problem.
Constraints

1≤T≤105
1≤N≤105
0≤xi,yi≤109
The sum of N over all test cases is at most 105.

Explanation
Case 1: Since there is only one point, the minimum area of a rectangle to cover this point is 0.
Case 2: We can have rectangles as 2 opposite sides of the square. Since the width of the rectangles is 0, the total area is also 0.

Case 3: The optimal solution is with the rectangles having endpoints {(1,1),(100,1),(1,50),(100,50)} and {(1,100),(1,100),(100,100),(100,100)}. Therefore the total area is 49⋅99+0⋅99=4851
