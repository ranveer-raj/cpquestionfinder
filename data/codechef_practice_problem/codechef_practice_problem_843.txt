Ram and Shyam are sitting next to each other, hoping to cheat on an exam. However, the examination board has prepared p different sets of questions (numbered 0 through p−1), which will be distributed to the students in the following way:

The students are assigned roll numbers — pairwise distinct positive integers.
If a student's roll number is r, this student gets the ((r−1)%p)-th set of questions.

Obviously, Ram and Shyam can cheat only if they get the same set of questions.
You are given the roll numbers of Ram and Shyam: A and B respectively. Find the number of values of p for which they can cheat, or determine that there is an infinite number of such values.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers A and B.

Output
For each test case, print a single line — the number of values of p for which Ram and Shyam can cheat, or −1 if there is an infinite number of such values.
Constraints

1≤T≤100
1≤A,B≤108
