In order to beat AlphaZero, Chef Ada is improving her chess calculation skills.
Today, Ada took a big chessboard with NN rows (numbered 11 through N) and N columns (numbered 1 through N). Let's denote the square in row r and column c of the chessboard by (r,c). Ada wants to place some rooks on the chessboard in such a way that the following conditions are satisfied:

Each square of the board contains at most one rook.
There are no four rooks forming a rectangle. Formally, there should not be any four valid integers r1, c1, r2, c2 (r1≠r2,c1≠c2) such that there are rooks on squares (r1,c1), (r1,c2), (r2,c1) and (r2,c2).
The number of rooks is at least 8N.

Help Ada find a possible distribution of rooks. If there are multiple solutions, you may find any one. It is guaranteed that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer N.

Output
For each test case, print N lines. For each valid i, the i-th of these lines should contain a single string with length N describing row i of the chessboard; for each valid j, the j-th character of this string should be 'O' if there is a rook in the square (i,j) or '.' if this square is empty.
Constraints

100≤N≤1,000
the sum of N2 over all test cases does not exceed 5⋅106

Subtasks
Subtask #1 (20 points): N≤200
Subtask #2 (80 points): original constraints
Example Input
1
100

Example Output
OO.O [96 characters follow]
O... [96 characters follow]
..O. [96 characters follow]
O... [96 characters follow]
[96 lines follow]

Explanation
The output depicts the top left 4×4 square on the board. The rest of the board is cropped.
