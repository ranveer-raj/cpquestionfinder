Chef is playing a game with his brother Chefu. He asked Chefu to choose a positive integer N, multiply it by a given integer A, then choose a divisor of N (possibly N itself) and add it to the product. Let's denote the resulting integer by M; more formally, M=A⋅N+d, where d is some divisor of N.
Chefu told Chef the value of M and now, Chef should guess N. Help him find all values of N which Chefu could have chosen.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers A and M.

Output
For each test case, print two lines. The first line should contain a single integer C denoting the number of possible values of N. The second line should contain C space-separated integers denoting all possible values of N in increasing order.
It is guaranteed that the sum of C over all test cases does not exceed 107.
