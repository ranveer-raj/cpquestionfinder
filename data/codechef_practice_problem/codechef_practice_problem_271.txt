Explanation

In first case X=10X=10 and Y=5Y=5, so RCB needs 1010 points from remaining 55 matches to qualify for playoffs. It is only possible if they win all their remaining 55 matches.
In second case X=1X=1 and Y=5Y=5, so RCB needs 11 points from their remaining 55 matches to qualify for playoffs. It can be done if they tie any one of their 55 matches and lose the remaining 44. So they need to win 00 matches.
