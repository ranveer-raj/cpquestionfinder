A sequence A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN of length NN is called good if any one of the following hold:

The sequence is strictly increasing, or
The sequence is strictly decreasing, or
There exists an index i(1<i<N) such that:
Aj<Aj+1, for each 1≤j<i
Aj>Aj+1, for each i≤j<N 

For example, the sequences [3,5,9], [2,1], [5,7,4,1] are good, while [6,7,7], [5,2,3] are not. 
You are given an array A consisting of N integers. Find a good sequence by rearranging the elements of the array A or report that this is impossible. If there are multiple good sequences, print the lexicographically largest one.
If two sequences A and B have the same length N, we say that A is lexicographically larger than B if there exists an index i, (1≤i≤N) such that A1=B1,A2=B2,…,Ai−1=Bi−1 and Ai>Bi.
Input Format

The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains an integer N, denoting the length of the array.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN, denoting the given array.

Output Format
For each test case, if it is not possible to rearrange the given array into a good sequence, print −1. Otherwise, print a single line containing N space-separated integers - the lexicographically largest good sequence that can be made.
Constraints

1≤T≤103
1≤N≤105
1≤Ai≤109
Sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 5⋅105

Explanation
Test case 1: The rearrangements of A which are good sequences are: [5,3,2], [3,5,2], [2,3,5], [2,5,3]. Among these, [5,3,2] is the lexicographically largest.
Test case 2: There is no way to obtain a good sequence by rearranging the elements of the array A=[1,1,1].
