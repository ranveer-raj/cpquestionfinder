Chef was on vacation when a thought struck him. Given three integers N,K,N,K, and X,X, he would like to make an array AA of length NN such that it satisfies the following conditions:

0≤Ai≤N0≤Ai≤N for each 1≤i≤N1≤i≤N
The MEX of every contiguous subarray of length KK in AA is XX.

Please help Chef in finding such an array. If there are multiple answers, you can output any configuration; and if there is no possible answer, output −1−1.
Note: The MEX of an array is the minimum non-negative integer that is not present in it. For example,

The MEX of array [0,2,5,1][0,2,5,1] is 3,3, because it contains 0,10,1 and 22 but not 33.
The MEX of array [1,2,5][1,2,5] is 0,0, because 00 is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.
The MEX of array [0,1,2,3][0,1,2,3] is 44.

Input Format

The first line of input contains a single integer TT, denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
Each test case consists of a single line of input, containing three space-separated integers N,K,XN,K,X — the length of the required array, the length of subarrays to be checked, and the required MEX value respectively.

Output Format
For each test case, output a single line containing the answer:

If no array satisfying the conditions exists, print −1−1.
Otherwise, print NN space-separated integers denoting the elements of the array, the ithith of which is AiAi.

If there are multiple answers, you can output any of them.

Explanation
Test Case 11: One possible answer is [0,1,2][0,1,2]. The subarray of length 33 has MEX 33. Other possible answers are [0,2,1][0,2,1], [1,0,2][1,0,2], [1,2,0][1,2,0], [2,0,1][2,0,1], [2,1,0][2,1,0].
Test Case 22: One possible answer is [1,0,1,1][1,0,1,1]. There are two subarrays of length 33 — [1,0,1][1,0,1] and [0,1,1][0,1,1]. Both of them have MEX 22, as required.
Test Case 33: There is no array that satisfies the given conditions.
