Chef has an array A with N elements. He wants to find N points P1,…,PN with integer coordinates on the 2D coordinate plane such that, for all pairs of indices i and j (1≤i<j≤N), the Manhattan distance from Pi to Pj is Ai+Aj. Help him find any N points satisfying the condition, or state that no such points exist.
As a reminder, the Manhattan distance between the points (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) is defined as |x1−x2|+|y1−y2|.
Input Format

The first line contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The T test cases then follow.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.

Output Format
For each test case, if there is no set of points satisfying the stated condition, output NO.
Otherwise, output YES on one line, then output N lines. Each line should contain two integers Xi and Yi (−1018≤Xi,Yi≤1018) denoting the x and y coordinates of the point Pi respectively.
It can be proven that if a solution exists, then a solution exists under the constraints above.
Output is case insensitive.
Constraints

1≤T≤104
1≤N≤2⋅105
1≤Ai≤109
Sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105

Explanation

For the first test case, we can choose P1=(3,9) and P2=(13,17). The Manhattan distance between P1 and P2 is |3−13|+|9−17|=18, and A1+A2=5+13=18.
For the second test case, we can choose P1=(18,5), P2=(10,1), and P3=(1,16).

The Manhattan distance between P1 and P2 is |18−10|+|5−1|=12, and A1+A2=8+4=12.
The Manhattan distance between P1 and P3 is |18−1|+|5−16|=28, and A1+A3=8+20=28.
The Manhattan distance between P2 and P3 is |10−1|+|1−16|=24, and A2+A3=4+20=24.
For the third test case, it can be proven that there does not exist 5 points satisfying these constraints.
