In computing, the collection of four bits is called a nibble.
Chef defines a program as:

Good, if it takes exactly XX nibbles of memory, where XX is a positive integer.
Not Good, otherwise.

Given a program which takes NN bits of memory, determine whether it is Good or Not Good.
Input Format

First line will contain TT, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer NN, the number of bits taken by the program.

Output Format
For each test case, output 𝙶𝚘𝚘𝚍Good or 𝙽𝚘𝚝 𝙶𝚘𝚘𝚍Not Good in a single line.
You may print each character of 𝙶𝚘𝚘𝚍Good or 𝙽𝚘𝚝 𝙶𝚘𝚘𝚍Not Good in uppercase or lowercase (for example, 𝙶𝚘𝙾𝚍GoOd, 𝙶𝙾𝙾𝙳GOOD, 𝚐𝚘𝚘𝚍good will be considered identical).

Explanation
Test case 1: The program requires 88 bits of memory. This is equivalent to 84=284=2 nibbles. Since 22 is an integer, this program is good.
Test case 2: The program requires 1717 bits of memory. This is equivalent to 174=4.25174=4.25 nibbles. Since 4.254.25 is not an integer, this program is not good.
Test case 3: The program requires 5252 bits of memory. This is equivalent to 524=13524=13 nibbles. Since 1313 is an integer, this program is good.
Test case 4: The program requires 33 bits of memory. This is equivalent to 34=0.7534=0.75 nibbles. Since 0.750.75 is not an integer, this program is not good.
