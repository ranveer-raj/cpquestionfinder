You are handed a binary string SS, but not in any ordinary form. Instead of being directly given the value of SS, you are given an array CC of size NN representing the 01-compression representation of SS. This means SS first contains C1C1 𝟶0 characters, then C2C2 𝟷1 characters, then C3C3 𝟶0 characters, and so on. For example, the array C=[2,3,4,3]C=[2,3,4,3] corresponds with the binary string 𝟶𝟶𝟷𝟷𝟷𝟶𝟶𝟶𝟶𝟷𝟷𝟷001110000111.
You are allowed to modify SS by swapping elements of CC. More specifically, you are allowed to swap CiCi and CjCj as long as CiCi and CjCj both encodes blocks of the same character. For example, from C=[2,3,4,3]C=[2,3,4,3], you can swap C1C1 and C3C3 because both of them encode blocks of 𝟶0's, turning CC to [4,3,2,3][4,3,2,3] and SS to 𝟶𝟶𝟶𝟶𝟷𝟷𝟷𝟶𝟶𝟷𝟷𝟷000011100111. However, you cannot swap C1C1 and C2C2 because C1C1 encodes a block of 𝟶0's, while C2C2 encodes a block of 𝟷1s.
Perform the swapping operation in any way as many times as you want (including zero times) so that the final string SS has as many 𝟶𝟷01 subsequences as possible. As a reminder, a subsequence of a string is a sequence that can be derived by deleting zero or more characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.
You need to find any optimal final array CC, for which the number of 𝟶𝟷01 subsequence will be the largest possible.
Input Format

The first line contains TT - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer NN - the size of the array CC.
The second line of each test case contains NN integers C1,C2,…,CNC1,C2,…,CN - the 𝟶𝟷01-compression representation of SS.

Output Format
For each test case, output two lines: the first line contains NN integers representing the optimal array CC, and the second line contains the maximum number of 𝟶𝟷01 subsequences.

Explanation

Test case 11: C=[2,3,4,3]C=[2,3,4,3], which means SS corresponds to 𝟶𝟶𝟷𝟷𝟷𝟶𝟶𝟶𝟶𝟷𝟷𝟷001110000111. The optimal list of operations is to only swap C1C1 and C3C3, resulting in C=[4,3,2,3]C=[4,3,2,3] and S=S= 𝟶𝟶𝟶𝟶𝟷𝟷𝟷𝟶𝟶𝟷𝟷𝟷000011100111, which has 3030 subsequences of 𝟶𝟷01.
