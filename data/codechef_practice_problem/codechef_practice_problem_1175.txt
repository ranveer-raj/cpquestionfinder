You are given an integer NN and a (00-indexed) binary string AA having length N+1. 
Find any permutation P of 0,1,2,...,N−1 (or determine that it does not exist) that satisfies the following conditions for all i (0≤i≤N): 

if Ai=0: No contiguous segment of P has mex equal to i 
if Ai=1: There exists at least one contiguous segment of P that has mex equal to i

If multiple permutations exist that satisfy the given conditions, print any.
Note: mex of a segment is the smallest non-negative number that does not occur in that segment.
Input Format

The first line contains the number of test cases T. Description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line of each test case contains the binary string A of length N+1.

Output Format
For each test case print :

Yes if there exists a permutation P that satisfies the conditions described in the statement, followed by the permutation P in the next line (If multiple permutations exist that satisfy the given conditions, print any).
No otherwise.

You may print each character of Yes and No in uppercase or lowercase (for example, yes, yEs, YES will be considered identical).
Constraints

1≤T≤104
2≤N≤3⋅105
|A|=N+1
It is guaranteed that the sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅105.

Explanation
Test case-1: One of the possible permutations satisfying the given conditions is [0,1] because:

mex([1])=0. Therefore the condition is satisfied for i=0.
mex([0])=1. Therefore the condition is satisfied for i=1.
mex([0,1])=2. Therefore the condition is satisfied for i=2.

Test case-2: It can be proven that no permutation exists that satisfies the given conditions.
Test case-3: One of the possible permutations satisfying the given conditions is [0,2,1,4,3] because:

mex([2])=0. Therefore the condition is satisfied for i=0.
mex([0,2])=1. Therefore the condition is satisfied for i=1.
There does not exist any segment with mex=2. Therefore the condition is satisfied for i=2.
mex([0,2,1])=3. Therefore the condition is satisfied for i=3.
There does not exist any segment with mex=4. Therefore the condition is satisfied for i=4.
mex([0,2,1,4,3])=5. Therefore the condition is satisfied for i=5.
