You are given an integer N. Output a permutation of values from 1 to N that satisfies the following condition:

gcd([1+A1,2+A2,3+A3,…,N+AN])>1

It can be proven that a solution always exists. If there are multiple permutations that can satisfy the condition, then output any one of them.
As a reminder,

A permutation of values from 1 to N is an array containing integers from 1 to N in any order but each of them appearing exactly once.
GCD stands for Greatest Common Divisor. The greatest common divisor of a sequence is the largest integer d such that all the numbers in sequence are divisible by d. For more information, refer to here.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The T test cases then follow.
The first line of each test case contains an integer N.

Output Format
For each test case, output on one line a permutation of values from 1 to N which satisfies the above condition.
Constraints

1≤T≤500
2≤N≤500


                        Sample Input 1
                        





1
4



                        Sample Output 1
                        





3 4 1 2


Explanation

For the first test case, gcd([1+3,2+4,3+1,4+2])=gcd([4,6,4,6])=2 which is greater than 1, so the given permutation satisfies the condition.
