When Chef was visiting a fair in Byteland, he met a magician. The magician had NN boxes (numbered 11 through NN) and a gold coin. He challenged Chef to play a game with him; if Chef won the game, he could have the coin, but if he lost, the magician would kidnap Chef.
At the beginning of the game, the magician places the gold coin into the XX-th box. Then, he performs SS swaps. To win, Chef needs to correctly identify the position of the coin after all swaps.
In each swap, the magician chooses two boxes AA and BB, moves the contents of box AA (before the swap) to box BB and the contents of box BB (before the swap) to box AA.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers NN, XX and SS.
SS lines follow. Each of these lines contains two space-separated integers AA and BB denoting a pair of swapped boxes.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the number of the box containing the gold coin after all swaps are performed.
