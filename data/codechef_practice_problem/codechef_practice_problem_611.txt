Ryan is a boy from a small town,  who has been given a task by his father. He has NN wooden planks, numbered from 11 to NN, which are colored either black or white.  
His task is to color all planks the same color! But there is some magic in the winds of his small town. Whenever he colors the ithith ( plank which has the color SiSi ) to a color PP then following events happen: 

if 2≤i≤N2≤i≤N and Si=Si−1Si=Si−1, then color of (i−1)th(i−1)th plank changes to PP.
if 1≤i≤N−11≤i≤N−1 and Si=Si+1Si=Si+1, then color of (i+1)th(i+1)th plank changes to PP. 

Now this process continues for the newly colored planks also. If none of the neighbors have same color, then nothing happens to the neighbors.  
Suppose Ryan has planks which have their coloring : BBWWWBBBWWWB 
If Ryan colors the fourth plank( whose color is WW ) to color BB, then the finally the planks would be colored as following: 
BBBBBBBBBBBB 
Ryan can choose any one of the NN planks and change its color as many times as he wants. Determine the minimum number of times Ryan has to paint a plank such that all planks get the same color at the end.
Input Format

First line will contain TT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
The first line of each test case consists of an integer NN the number of planks
Second line of each test case consists of a string SS of size NN,where the ii th character denotes the color of plank ii 

Output Format
For each testcase, output a single integer denoting the minimum number of times Ryan has to paint a single plank such that all planks get the same color at the end.
Constraints

1≤T≤1051≤T≤105
1≤N≤1051≤N≤105
SS consists only of characters BB and WW 
The sum of NN over all cases doesn't exceed 105105.

Explanation
Test case 1:
The first test case is already described in the question.
Test case 2:
Ryan can paint the third plank to WW. After doing so the color string of planks become WWWWBWWWWB. Then he can again paint the third plank to the color BB. 
After doing so the string goes through following transitions:

The color of third plank changes to BB. ( The string becomes WWBWBWWBWB )
The color of second and fourth plank changes to BB. ( The string becomes WBBBBWBBBB )
The color of first plank changes to BB. ( The string becomes BBBBBBBBBB )

Finally, all planks have same color.
Test case 3:
All planks have the same color.
Test case 4:
Ryan can paint any of the planks numbered from 33 to 77 to WW, and all these planks will be colored to WW!
