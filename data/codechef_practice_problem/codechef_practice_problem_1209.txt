A circular array of length NN is defined as follows: NN integers A1,A2,…,AN are placed in a circle in such a way that for each 1≤i<N, Ai and Ai+1 are adjacent, and A1 and AN are also adjacent.
You are given a circular array A of length N. At the end of each second, the following changes are executed in the array: If Ai>0 then the elements which are adjacent to Ai, will get incremented by 1, for all 1≤i≤N.
For example, consider the array A=[0,0,0,2,0,0,0,5]. 

Initially A4 and A8 are greater than zero. So after one second, A3, A5, A1 and A7 will get incremented by 1. Hence the array will become A=[1,0,1,2,1,0,1,5].
After two seconds, the array becomes A=[2,2,2,4,2,2,2,7]. Note that the value of A4 has become 4, because both, A3 and A5 were greater than zero after one second.

What will be the sum of elements present in the array A after K seconds?
Input Format

The first line will contain T, number of testcases. Then T testcases follow.
The first line of each testcase contains 2 space separated integers N and K.
The second line of each testcase line contains N integers A1,A2,…,AN. 

Output Format
For each testcase, output in a single line containing the sum of the all the elements present in the array A after K seconds.
Constraints

1≤T≤104
3≤N≤105
0≤Ai≤106
0≤K≤109
Sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 106.

Explanation
Test Case 1: After one second, the array will become A=[1,1,2,1,1,0]. So the sum of elements present in the array is = 1+1+2+1+1+0=6.
Test Case 2: No change will be executed in the array as K=0. So the required sum will be equal to 3.
