You are given an odd integer N and two integer sequences A1,A2,…,AN and B1,B2,…,BN.
Your task is to reorder the elements of B, forming a new sequence C1,C2,…,CN (i.e. choose a permutation P1,P2,…,PN of the integers 1 through N, where Ci=BPi for each valid i), in such a way that the following condition holds: (A1⊕C1)=(A2⊕C2)=…=(AN⊕CN), where ⊕ denotes bitwise XOR. Find one such reordered sequence or determine that it is impossible.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.
The third line contains N space-separated integers B1,B2,…,BN.

Output
For each test case:

If there is no valid way to reorder the sequence B, print a single line containing the integer −1.
Otherwise, print a single line containing N space-separated integers C1,C2,…,CN. If there are multiple solutions, you may find any one.

Constraints

1≤T≤10
1≤N≤105
N is odd
0≤Ai≤106 for each valid i
0≤Bi≤106 for each valid i
