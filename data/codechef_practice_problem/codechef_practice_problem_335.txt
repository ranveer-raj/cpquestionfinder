Chef is working on his swap-based sorting algorithm for strings.
Given a string SS of length NN, he wants to know whether he can sort the string using his algorithm.
According to the algorithm, one can perform the following operation on string SS any number of times:

Choose some index ii (1≤i≤N)(1≤i≤N) and swap the ithith character from the front and the ithith character from the back.
More formally, choose an index ii and swap SiSi and S(N+1−i)S(N+1−i).

For example, 𝚍⎯⎯𝚌𝚋𝚊⎯⎯d_cba_ can be converted to 𝚊⎯⎯𝚌𝚋𝚍⎯⎯a_cbd_ using one operation where i=1i=1.
Help Chef find if it is possible to sort the string using any (possibly zero) number of operations.
Input Format

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT, denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains NN, the length of the string.
The second line contains a string SS of length NN consisting of lowercase letters of the Latin alphabet.

Output Format
For each test case, print 𝚈𝙴𝚂YES if it is possible to sort the string by performing any number of operations. Otherwise, print 𝙽𝙾NO.
You may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings 𝚈𝚎𝚂YeS, 𝚢𝙴𝚜yEs, 𝚢𝚎𝚜yes and 𝚈𝙴𝚂YES will all be treated as identical).
Constraints

1≤T≤1001≤T≤100
1≤N≤1031≤N≤103
Sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅1032⋅103.
SS consists of lowercase Latin alphabets only.

Explanation
Test case 11: Chef can sort the string using 11 operation.

Choose i=1i=1 and swap S1=𝚍S1=d and S4=𝚊S4=a.
This way, the string becomes 𝚊𝚋𝚌𝚍abcd.

Hence, the string is sorted.
Test case 22: Chef needs 00 operations to sort this string as it is already sorted.
Test case 33: It can be proven that the given string cannot be sorted using any number of operations.
