Read problems statements in mandarin chinese, russian and vietnamese as well.
You are given 2 arrays W =  (W1, W2, .., WN) and C =  (C1, C2, .., CN) with N elements each. A range [l, r] is unique if all the elements Cl, Cl+1, .., Cr are unique (ie. no duplicates). The sum of the range is Wl +  Wl+1 + ... + Wr.
You want to find an unique range with the maximum sum possible, and output this sum.
Input

The first line of the input contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of each testcase follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N, denoting the size of the arrays.
The second line contains N space-separated integers : C1, C2, .., CN.
The third line contains N space-separated integers : W1, W2, .., WN.

Output
For each testcase, output a single integer in a new line, which should be the maximum possible sum of an unique range.
Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ N ≤ 1000000
0 ≤ Ci < N
0 ≤ Wi ≤ 1000000000
 1 ≤ Sum of N over all test cases ≤ 1000000

Subtasks

Subtask #1 (30 points): Sum of N over all test cases ≤ 10000
Subtask #2 (70 points): Original constraints

                        Sample Output 1
                        





21


Explanation
The range [2, 4] is an unique range because (1, 2, 0) has no duplicates. Its sum is 6 + 7 + 8 = 21. This is the maximum possible, and hence is the answer.
