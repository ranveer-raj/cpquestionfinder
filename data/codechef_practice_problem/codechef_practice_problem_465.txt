Alice just invited Bob to come over for dinner at her place. Bob is not dressed properly and he does not wish to take any chances, so he wants to rush to an apartment of one of his NN friends, change there and meet Alice for the dinner.
Alice and Bob's friends live in a skyscraper with many floors. Alice lives on the aa-th floor, the apartments of Bob's friends are located on the floors F1,F2,…,FNF1,F2,…,FN and Bob is initially at the bb-th floor. It takes exactly 11 minute to go one floor up or down from each floor.
Bob needs exactly cc minutes to change in any of his friends' apartments. Find the minimum time he needs to go to one of his friends' apartments, change and get to Alice's apartment.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains four space-separated integers NN, aa, bb and cc.
The second line contains NN space-separated integers F1,F2,…,FNF1,F2,…,FN.

Output
Print a single line containing one integer ― the minimum time Bob needs.

Explanation
Example case 1: In the optimal solution, Bob goes to his friend at floor 66, changes there and goes to meet Alice. The total time is (6−5)(6−5) to reach his friend plus 22 to change plus (6−1)(6−1) to reach Alice, which is 1+2+5=81+2+5=8 minutes.
